# Emacs Setup

My personal emacs config

It uses [spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/) with the following plugins

- fuzzy finder
- git
- language support for Go, JS and Python

## Usage

For MacOS and Linux, just copy and paste the following command in your terminal:

```
curl -sLf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marco-souza/emacs-setup/main/setup.sh | bash

# or

curl -sLf https://cutt.ly/emacs-setup | bash
```
